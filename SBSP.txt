I'm picking up Spongebob and Patrick at the Indy Airport tomorrow. Their flight gets in from Miami at 1130 (AA flight 3517 and yes that's a real flight because they ARE coming!). Spongebob and Patrick want to kick it in Indy for a bit and check out Downtown and the Stadiums.  We'll drive up with some buffer time before 7 so they can freshen up. Then they look forward to ROCKING THEIR FACES OFF WITH YOU!!
Are you excited? 
I'm excited! 
Noms is excited. 
I know. 
Poor bastard won't be able to sleep tonight he's so excited.
If you aren't like Noms and can sleep, then dream of tropical islands, ocean breezes, pineapples, crazy winter olympic sports, aquatic racing, and the most badass Porifera (Spongebob) and Echinodermata (Patrick) out there!

Don't forget to wear your Speedo and bring a beach towel!
Sippin Margaritas and Banging Senoritas,
Capt. Salty Old Bawls
Random Fact: Spongebob does P90X and is ripped! He has 6 pack abs hiding under that sensible looking dress shirt and tie!


(can I get a round of applause? I've done a lot of work planning to get you guys fucked up. I enjoyed it but wouldn't mind a thank you. But thank them all for coming. Thank PTC for representing at Nats and donig a kick ass job. Callout to Cam leaving "I'll miss this guy. Some of my best blackout drunk nights have been partying with Cam after BMFs. I feel that without Cam my bad-good drinking ideas or good-bad drinking ideas would never have come to fruition. So raise a glass for Cam! He'll be missed.")
