Get Excited email/Message:
I'm picking up Spongebob and Patrick at the Indy Airport tomorrow. Their flight gets in from Miami at 1130 (AA flight 3517 and yes that's a real flight because they ARE coming!). Spongebob and Patrick want to kick it in Indy for a bit and check out Downtown and the Stadiums.  We'll drive up with some buffer time before 7 so they can freshen up. Then they look forward to ROCKING THEIR FACES OFF WITH YOU!!
Are you excited? I'm excited! Noms is excited. I know. Poor bastard won't be able to sleep tonight he's so excited.
If you aren't like Noms and can sleep, then dream of tropical islands, ocean breezes, pineapples, crazy winter olympic sports, aquatic racing, and the most badass Porifera (Spongebob) and Echinodermata (Patrick) out there!

Don't forget to wear your Speedo and bring a beach towel!
Sippin Margaritas and Banging Senoritas,
Capt. Salty Old Bawls
