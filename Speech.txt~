First there are a few orders of business..
1)Thank you:
Thank you all for coming. Without you I'd be sitting at home drinking by myself with a doll of SB & Patrick watching the cartoon. So thank you for showing up and letting me help you get fucked up. I really enjoyed planning all this and hopefully all of you enjoy the night.

2)Cam: 
Most of you know Cam. He is a great guy. I personally spent 3 weeks of my life Driving Miss Daisy around the country. Most of you don't know that Cam is a douchebag.  He is leaving in short time and heading off to the Army. Therefore as a way to recognize that I wouldn't have made nearly as many bad decisions in grad school if it weren't for you we have a little gift to tell you that Triclub hearts you and will miss you. So if you have a man or lady crush on Cam best make a move since he's going to be dodging bullets soon.

3)Nats:
Congrats at kicking ass at Nats. You have no idea how much I wanted to be there.

4)Mu'umu Award:
Michael Dunten. I don't know you very well, but well enough to make fun of you. YOU fine sir are the only person to get a Large shirt. 

5)Let's be safe:
And last but not least, there are varying skill levels of drinkers. Some ohave been drinking longer than others. That doesn't mean shit because many of you have seen how fucked up I can get under my own steam and I've been drinking for a good spell. So anyway, moral of the story: No when to say when and be safe. Really I want you to all have a good time but not to end up in the hospital.

6)And now....are you READY!
